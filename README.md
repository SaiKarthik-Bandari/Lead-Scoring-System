# 💼 Lead Scoring System (Java Console Project)

This is a simple Java console application that simulates a **lead qualification and scoring system** used by inside sales strategists.

## 🎯 Objective
Score a sales lead based on answers to four qualification questions:
- Budget
- Authority
- Need
- Timeline

Each **"Yes"** answer earns 1 point.  
If the total score is **3 or more**, the lead is marked as **HIGH priority**.  
Otherwise, it is **LOW priority**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Basic console I/O)
- Scanner class for user input
